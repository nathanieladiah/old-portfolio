							A wailing siren splitting the evening air. The shouts of fearful neighbours. The colour of
							thick black smoke and the smell of burning wood. These were the things that assaulted my
							senses that Friday evening. The day that someone's world ended.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had been out with my friend for a game of football after school that day. So when I was
							making my way home it was already dark and the breeze was chilly. As I was nearing my 
							destination, the sweet, serene silence of the evening was torn by the distinct screams of a 
							siren. In a flash of red, a fire truck sped past me and barreled down the street.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was alarmed, for at the time, I saw the smoke rising into the air. It appeared to be coming 
							from the location of my house. My heart leapt into my throat as I was overcome with foreboding. 
							But then I forced myself to relax, my parents were home and they would have called me if something
							was wrong. It wasn't my house but it had to be close to it.
						</p>
						<p>
							I raced down the street to my house, fear lending wings to my feet. When I turned the corner of my 
							street, a horrific sight met my eyes. Two doors down from my house, my neighbour's house was ablaze.
							The red-orange flames were consuming her house. The fire was leaping out of the windows and dancing
							across the roof in a brilliant display against the back drop of the approaching night.
						</p>
						<p>
							A crowd had gathered around the house as the fire fighters, dressed for battle, waged war against the
							endless flames. I saw my parents among the crowd and I hurried to join them. I could feel the hear from
							the house where I stood and I heard the crackling of the fire, eating the wood inside.
						</p>
						<p>
							Praise ran high among the neighbours gathered. They were worried that the fire might catch onto their
							houses. The next door neighbours of the burning house were throwing buckets of water onto their own 
							houses to prevent the fire spreading. The owner of the house just sat on the curb head in her hands. Her
							friends tried to console her but there was nothing they could really do.

							The firefighters knew their trade and the fire was soon under control. The only incident, being when a gas tank
							exploded, causing a fireball to be catapulted onto the street. However, this caused nothing but panic and the
							fire was reduced to smoldering ashes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fire was extinguished, but the house was razed. The woman who owned the house was now homeless and her face
							betrayed the sadness only those who have lost everything can know. She would stay with friends for a while, but no
							one would argue that her world had ended.
